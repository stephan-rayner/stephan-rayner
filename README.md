### Hi Friend 👋

I am Stephan and this is my github page.

#### A Bit About Me
- 💕 I love talking about software, distributed systems problems, data problems, cooking, and making things.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - At 🏠 I write software and 3d print CAD models to make life a little easier
  - For 💰 I  write event-sourced backend applications, infrastructure, prototypes, and CI pipelines for mobile games.
- 📚 Once upon a time I voleteered teaching highschool students how to program and build robots. I would love to do that again.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Projects that help people (I would like to leave the world better than I found it).
- 💬 Ask me about every way to cook an egg.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to juggle.
