<h1 align="center"> Hello Friend 👋 </h1>
<h3 align="center">I am Stephan and this is me on github</h3>

#### A Bit About Me
- 💕 I love talking about software, distributed systems problems, data problems, cooking, and making things.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - At 🏠 I write software and 3d print CAD models to make life a little easier.
  - For 💰 I  develop a machine learning platform focusing on reinforcement learning. Making ML models that can play mobile games better than me.
- 📚 Once upon a time I voleteered teaching highschool students how to program and build robots. I would love to do that again.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Projects that help people

- 💬 Ask me about every way to cook an egg.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning French ... again.
